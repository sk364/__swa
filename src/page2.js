          <p>Dwight (the guy in the image) is literally correct. While we want to believe that an individual at any age can do any shit,</p>
          <p>the measure of how old you are still matters when it comes to biological processes. Don't worry, I am not gonna tell you further on it.</p>
          <p>What I have is some cool facts about the number 26:</p>
          <p>* 26 is the only integer that is one greater than a square (5<sup>2</sup> + 1) and one less than a cube (3<sup>3</sup> âˆ’ 1).<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.normalesup.org/~baglio/maths/26number.pdf">[1]</a></sup></p>
          <p>* Taking A=1 and Z=26, GOD = G + O + D = 26</p>
          <p>* In numerology, number 26 represents diplomacy, family and teamwork. It's also considered lucky for business!</p>
          <img src="./meme5.gif" />
          <p>Guess how many sides this shape has! It's called rhombicuboctahedron as it has 26 faces, btw. Try spelling it until you get it right!</p>
          <p>26 is an okay number, nothing much too great about it. * waits until you are 33 years old</p>

          <p>I know I just wrote one word (max two) word adjectives to describe you, which clearly isn't satisfying.</p>
          <p>Even words have a limit of expression.</p>
          <p>Pictures on the other hand tries to fill the verbal gaps. Here are some to help you see how you have grown over the years:</p>

          <div className="img-group">
            {iter.map((_, idx) => {
              const ext = idx === 15 ? "gif" : "jpg";
              return (<img className="img-item" src={`./n${idx + 1}.${ext}`} id="cute" />);
            })}
          </div>

          <p>Look at you! All mature and shit. Well, if it wasn't obvious, I want you know that</p>
          <p>you mean a lot to me and I am glad that you exist!</p>
          <p>I love you and yeah, happy birthday! :D</p>
